The indie band flourished for a while, at one point boldly refusing to succumb to the establishment. But alas, Tan’s getting older, the popularity of his band is dwindling, and life isn’t getting any easier financially, which is why he eventually signs with a label this late in the game.

There, he meets Toua Tokuchi, a 134 km/h (83 mph) pitcher and the undisputed king of a gambling form of baseball called \"One Outs\". At Kojima's urging, Tokuchi signs up with the Lycaons. His contract, the 'One Outs contract', differs from the usual, though, in that he gets 5,000,000 yen for every out he pitches, but loses 50,000,000 yen for every run he gives up.",
